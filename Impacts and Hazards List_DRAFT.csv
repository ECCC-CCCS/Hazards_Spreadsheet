Jeremy,Phase 1.1,Snow and Ice,Blizzard / Winter storm,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Blizzards are intense winter snowstorms driven by a combination of factors: strong winds, heavy snowfall, and sub-zero temperatures. To support snowfall (rather than rain), temperatures need to remain below freezing, making blizzards a multivariate climate hazard. This hazard therefore depends on the convergence of freezing temperatures, extreme precipitation, and high wind speeds.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change is expected to impact blizzards and winter storms through shifts in snow and wind climate impact drivers, with varied effects depending on the location. In regions where winter temperatures are increasingly fluctuating above and below freezing, there may be a reduction in blizzard frequency, as more winter storms may manifest as rain events. However, in regions with consistently sub-zero temperatures during winter, increased winter precipitation intensity due to a warmer atmosphere could lead to more intense blizzards.

Cary,Phase 1,Wet and Dry,Drought - Agricultural and ecological,"Mechanisms and Drivers
Drought is often defined as a temporary period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause hydrological imbalance. It affects several components of the water cycle, including soil moisture, surface, and subsurface water levels. Droughts can also be exacerbated by increases in evapotranspiration associated with high temperatures. 

An agricultural or ecological drought event occurs when there is a deficit in soil moisture levels, and water availability. The use of “agricultural” versus “ecological” droughts is largely  dependent on the affected biome. 

The primary drivers are insufficient precipitation (or snowmelt) and high evapotranspiration. Insufficient rainfall (or snowmelt) can lead to precipitation deficits, reducing soil moisture levels and limiting water availability for crops. Elevated rates of evapotranspiration, the combined loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation from surfaces and transpiration from plants, can deplete soil moisture rapidly.

The role of climate change
An accelerated water cycle, driven by climate change, is intensifying hydrological processes in Canada. Rapid evaporation, increased precipitation, and faster water cycling are disrupting the traditional water balance, leading to more frequent and severe extremes like droughts and floods.

Depending on the region and specific local conditions, climate change is likely to both reduce and increase agricultural and ecological drought in Canada. Shifts in the distribution, intensity, and seasonality of rainfall will alter drought dynamics. Many regions are projected to see an increase in precipitation while others are projected to see more prolonged dry periods between rainfall events. 

Rising temperatures are associated with accelerated evapotranspiration rates, meaning more loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation from surfaces and transpiration from plants. 

Some areas, like the south prairies, will experience increased agricultural or ecological drought due to disproportionate changes in temperature relative to precipitation. Whereas areas in northern Canada will have changes in temperature more balanced by changes in precipitation.","General, Agriculture/Plants",CCCR2025,Agricultural and ecological drought,N/A,Precipitation and Potential evapotranspitation,"Tier 3: Low - Low agreement about direction and/or amount of change, high noise to signal ratio  ","SPEI 3, 12, 24 Months","The Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is a drought index based on the difference between precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET).

Negative (positive) values indicate water deficit (surplus), while zero indicates no change relative to historical conditions.","The Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combines the main two components of drought: precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from temperature.

It is important to remember that this proxy is currently only available as relative SPEI. Therefore, it indicates if water deficit is higher/lower than in the past. This proxy also does not account for actual evapotranspiration, snowmelt and runoff or surface water demand (both of which are primarily driven by non-climatic factors).

Droughts can also be exacerbated by increases in evapotranspiration associated with high temperatures. 

A hydrological drought occurs when runoff deficit and evaporative demand affect surface water or groundwater availability. This type of drought speaks to longer term dryness, and is characterized by reduced streamflow, groundwater levels, and water supply in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and aquifers. It often occurs following low snow years and/or prolonged precipitation deficits. 

The role of climate change 
An accelerated water cycle, driven by climate change, is intensifying hydrological processes in Canada. Rapid evaporation, increased precipitation, and faster water cycling are disrupting the traditional water balance, leading to more frequent and severe extremes like droughts and floods.

Depending on the region and specific local conditions, climate change is likely to both reduce and increase hydrological drought in Canada. Shifts in the distribution, intensity, and seasonality of rainfall will alter drought dynamics. Many regions are projected to see an increase in precipitation while others are projected to see more prolonged dry periods between rainfall events.

Rising temperatures are associated with accelerated evapotranspiration rates, meaning more loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation from surfaces and transpiration from plants.

Snowpack is projected to change in many northern and mountainous regions, where snowmelt serves as a vital source of water for downstream ecosystems, agriculture, and urban areas. Rising temperatures are causing earlier snowmelt, reduced snow accumulation, and changes in the timing and magnitude of spring freshet. However, many of these areas may see an increase in snowpack in the coming decades before a decrease later in the century. 

Changes in precipitation, temperature, and snowpack can affect freshet and runoff patterns and hydrological processes in watersheds. Alterations in the timing, magnitude, and duration of freshet and runoff events have implications for water availability. In some locations freshet will start earlier, meaning a greater need for water storage.

Some areas, like the south prairies, will experience increased hydrological drought due to disproportionate changes in temperature relative to precipitation. Whereas areas in the north will have changes in temperature balanced by changes in precipitation.

The role of climate change 
An accelerated water cycle, driven by climate change, is intensifying hydrological processes in Canada. Rapid evaporation, increased precipitation, and faster water cycling are disrupting the traditional water balance, leading to more frequent and severe extremes like droughts and floods.

Depending on the region and specific local conditions, climate change is likely to both reduce and increase hydrological drought in Canada. Shifts in the distribution, intensity, and seasonality of rainfall will alter drought dynamics. Many regions are projected to see an increase in precipitation while others are projected to see more prolonged dry periods between rainfall events.

Rising temperatures are associated with accelerated evapotranspiration rates, meaning more loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation from surfaces and transpiration from plants.

Snowpack is projected to change in many northern and mountainous regions, where snowmelt serves as a vital source of water for downstream ecosystems, agriculture, and urban areas. Rising temperatures are causing earlier snowmelt, reduced snow accumulation, and changes in the timing and magnitude of spring freshet. However, many of these areas may see an increase in snowpack in the coming decades before a decrease later in the century. 

Changes in precipitation, temperature, and snowpack can affect freshet and runoff patterns and hydrological processes in watersheds. Alterations in the timing, magnitude, and duration of freshet and runoff events have implications for water availability. In some locations freshet will start earlier, meaning a greater need for water storage.

Some areas, like the south prairies, will experience increased hydrological drought due to disproportionate changes in temperature relative to precipitation. Whereas areas in the north will have changes in temperature balanced by changes in precipitation.

Callie,Phase 1,Heat and Cold,Extreme cold,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Extreme cold events are primarily driven by the movement of polar and Arctic air into lower latitudes. This process can be intensified by factors such as clear skies, snow cover, wind chill, and geographical features that trap cold air. The severity of extreme cold depends on the actual temperature and humidity, while wind speed (resulting in wind chill) and precipitation (particularly snowfall) also impact the perceived cold and sustain low ground temperatures.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change is expected to lead to a general warming trend, reducing the intensity and frequency of extreme cold events over time. However, disruptions in atmospheric circulation due to climate change may create situations where cold air outbreaks into lower latitudes become more unpredictable and possibly more frequent, even as overall warming continues. In some regions, a reduction in snow and ice cover may also affect cold air dynamics. Thus, climate change may lead to fewer extreme cold events in some areas, while in others, disrupted atmospheric patterns could increase the likelihood of extreme cold events despite an overall warming climate.",General,DST,Cold spell,N/A,Air Temperature,Tier 1: High - Strong agreement in direction of change and amount of change,Cold Spell Days,"Cold Spell Days represent the number of days in a specific period that fall within a cold spell, defined as a consecutive number of days with daily mean temperatures below a threshold specific to the region. Cold spells can occur any time of the year, though they are more significant in colder months. This proxy is particularly useful because it captures the duration of extreme cold periods, a key aspect of extreme cold hazards.","Cold waves and cold spells are defined differently throughout literature but generally are multi-day periods with low temperature extremes. Cold spells occur any time in the year while the term cold wave is typically used during the colder months (WMO, 2023). The definition of low temperature extreme is region dependent. 

Extreme cold may have impacts on human health as “cold temperatures are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and stroke-related illness and mortality” (CCCR Series Health of Canadians in a Changing Climate). Cold waves and spells can also impact agriculture (WMO, 2023).

This proxy shows how the number of days in cold spells meeting region-specific criteria will change over time and is a relevant proxy because it reflects the changing duration aspect of extreme cold. Note this proxy is not showing the frequency of cold spells or the duration of a single cold spell, instead it provides the total number of days over the time period that are in cold spells.

This proxy is particularly useful because it allows users to input region-specific extreme cold criteria, which often includes a number consecutive days below a temperature threshold. Users may want to work with the MSC's Extreme Cold warnings for their region, available here:
https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/types-weather-forecasts-use/public/criteria-alerts.html#extremeCold

Note that the MSC's extreme cold warnings are more related to cold snaps (as the time frame is shorter, and most are issued when the temperature or wind chill is expected to reach a temperature threshold for at least two hours). Users may also want to consider calculating and using percentiles to define an extreme cold threshold (e.g., 95/97/97.5/98/99th percentile Tmin values compared to baseline).

Note this proxy is not showing the frequency of heat waves or the duration of a single heat wave, instead it provides the total number of days over the time period that are in heat waves. This proxy can also be used to evaluate the shoulder seasons for heat waves by using the monthly temporal frequency. 

This proxy is particularly useful because it allows users to input region-specific heat wave criteria, which often includes a number consecutive days above a maximum and minimum temperature threshold.

Temperature is a primary indicator of climate change, as increasing greenhouse gas emissions leads to the warming of the lower atmosphere.

Extreme heat in Canada is driven by persistent high pressure systems in the atmosphere, in many areas it is also influenced by humidity. Extreme heat in the atmosphere is formed through complex interactions between various atmospheric and oceanic processes. 

The role of climate change
Temperature is a key indicator of climate change, as increasing GHG emissions causes warming of the lower atmosphere. Changes in extreme temperatures are closely related to changes in mean temperature (CCCR, 2019), so as mean temperatures rise so will extreme hot temperatures. Extreme heat is a dangerous weather condition that is becoming more common and severe as climate change warms the planet. Extreme heat will become more frequent and more intense, with magnitude changes proportional to the magnitude of mean temperature changes (CCCR, 2019). The urban heat island effect also can exacerbate extreme heat and heat waves by buildings abosorbing and retaining heat, making many urban areas warmer than rural areas (ClimateData.ca). The impacts of extreme heat can range from impacts on human health, agriculture, and can impact fire weather.

Jeremy,Phase 1,Wet and Dry,Flood - Ice jam,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Ice jams occur when river ice obstructs water flow, causing potential flooding. This can happen either as new ice forms, constricting flow, or as ice breaks up in spring, moving downstream and becoming trapped in narrow sections of a river. Spring ice jams are particularly damaging as they coincide with high flow conditions from snowmelt. Ice jams are responsible for a significant percentage of flood events in Canada, especially in northern areas where up to 50% of floods may be ice-induced.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
The effect of climate change on ice jam floods varies by location and depends on river ice characteristics, breakup patterns, and seasonal conditions. Warmer temperatures may reduce ice cover, potentially decreasing ice jam frequency in some areas. Conversely, increased spring flows from rain-on-snow events in areas that retain significant ice cover could increase ice jam occurrences. The dominance of particular climate change influenced ice jam flood mechanisms must therefore be assessed on a case-by-case basis.",General,"DST, CCCR2025",River Flood,Riverine flooding - Ice jam,Air Temperature,,Icing Days,"An Icing Day is defined as a day when the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) is at or below 0°C. This proxy is useful for understanding conditions that sustain river ice, setting the stage for potential ice jam flooding.
Caution Note: Currently, there is no single, compound proxy that adequately capture the specific conditions needed for ice jams (e.g., ice thickness, snowmelt rates, intense rain events, or river flow rates). This proxy only indicates the presence of freezing temperatures.","Each winter and spring, river ice jams generate flooding and cause significant damage in Canada and in other cold countries of the world. These ice jams are mostly associated with dynamic river-ice breakup events, characterized by the rupture and mobilization of a resistant ice cover by a rapidly rising discharge. The combination of a competent ice cover subject to a significant increase in runoff (caused by high snowmelt rates or an intense rain event) is the normal scenario leading to an ice jam flood.",Frequency,Poor,Low,Low,CanDCS-U5/U6,6x10 km,,Climate Atlas of Canada,Currently Available,,,"Health in a Changing Climate (2022)

,Phase 1,Wet and Dry,Flood - Pluvial/Heavy Precipitation,"Mechanisms and drivers
Pluvial flooding occurs when heavy rainfall creates a flood event that isn't related to a particular water body (lake, river, ocean, etc.).  Essentially it is when it rains so hard that the water builds up on the ground faster than it can drain.

The role of climate change 
An accelerated water cycle, driven by climate change, is intensifying hydrological processes in Canada. Rapid evaporation, increased precipitation, and faster water cycling are disrupting the traditional water balance, leading to more frequent and severe extremes like droughts and floods.

Climate change will impact Canadian pluvial flooding by increasing the intensity of extreme precipitation events.  This will occur primarily because a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, thus allowing for more rainfall to occur during individual rain events.

Jeremy,Phase 1,Wet and Dry,Flood - Spring freshet,"Mechanisms and drivers
Spring freshet flooding occurs when there is a combination of large snowpack and warm temperature leading to rapid melt.  Freshet flooding is often exacerbated by rain-on-snow events.  

The role of climate change
An accelerated water cycle, driven by climate change, is intensifying hydrological processes in Canada. Rapid evaporation, increased precipitation, and faster water cycling are disrupting the traditional water balance, leading to more frequent and severe extremes like droughts and floods.

Climate change will cause changes to the average frequency and severity of spring freshet flooding, although both the direction and magnitude of change is very dependent on location.  For example, in southern maritime regions that may experience extensive snow loss, spring freshet flooding  frequency/magnitude could decrease.  Conversely, interior regions may experience greater freshet flooding in response to increased prevalence of rain-on-snow events in the presence of a continued substantial spring snowpack.

Because spring freshet flooding is a highly compound event that depends on the superposition of both prior (antecedent) seasonal snowpack conditions and short-duration spring-time extreme weather events (heat and rain), predicting changes to freshet flooding is technically and statistically complex task.

1.	Measurement and Simulation Challenges: Freezing precipitation, often mixed with other types, is challenging to measure and simulate due to its lower frequency and specific temperature requirements for formation. Groisman et al. (2016) observed a decrease in freezing precipitation frequency in the southeastern US but an increase in northern parts of North America.
2.	Climate Change Impact Studies: Studies show a poleward shift of future freezing precipitation due to rising surface temperatures. However, coarse resolutions of some models, like CGCM3, may not accurately project regional changes.

Carly,Phase 1.1,Heat and Cold,Frost,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Frost occurs when surface temperatures drop below the freezing point, causing moisture in the air to condense and freeze on surfaces. The key drivers of frost formation include low nighttime temperatures, high humidity, and radiational cooling. 
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change can influence frost hazards by shifting temperature patterns and seasonal timing. As global temperatures rise, some regions may experience fewer frost days, reducing the frequency of frost events. However, changing weather patterns can also lead to sudden temperature drops or shifts in the timing of frost.

Under these conditions frost might form at ground level or on cold surfaces. The frequency of frost days is an indicator of the length and severity of the winter season. A location with a higher frequency of frost days is also likely to have a short growing season, since frost is harmful to many plants. Increasing air temperature has an inverse relationship with frost days. Warmer temperatures lead to less frost days. This can have both positive impacts (longer growing season, plants being able to grow in different environments (Wazneh et al., 2019)) and negative impacts (destructive insects lasting through the winter season) on vegetation and trees. Warmer air temperatures can affect the duration of frost-free days during the winter, which can lead to tree and vegetation damage as the plants are “awakened” by warmer temperatures too early in the season and may be damaged if temperatures drop and frost returns.",Frequency,Good ,,,CanDCS-U5/U6,6x10 km,,"Climate Atlas of Canada

Ryan,Phase 1.1,Snow and Ice,Hail,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Hail forms when strong updrafts in thunderstorms lift raindrops into high, sub-zero layers of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze. These hailstones grow as they cycle through areas of supercooled water within the storm, accumulating layers of ice until they become too heavy for the updrafts to support and fall to the ground. Geographic and meteorological factors make certain areas particularly susceptible to severe hail events. Canada’s 'Hailstorm Alley,' which includes Calgary and Edmonton in Southern Alberta, experiences some of the most frequent and severe hailstorms globally. 
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change may influence hail hazards by altering atmospheric conditions that contribute to hail formation. As temperatures rise, increased atmospheric moisture and instability could lead to more frequent or intense thunderstorms, potentially increasing the likelihood of hail formation in some areas. However, warmer surface temperatures may also cause more hailstones to melt before reaching the ground, affecting hail size and distribution. Additionally, changes in jet stream patterns and storm tracks could shift the regions most affected by severe hail. At this time the exact effects of climate change on hail hazards are complex and still being studied.",General,DST,Hail,N/A,Precipitation,"Tier 4: Not Applicable - Early stages of modelling and analysis, next steps and/or experiments proposed to advance scientific understanding",Hail,"This proxy represents a form of precipitation consisting of solid ice that usually forms inside thunderstorm.

This leads to an anticipated increase in hail damage potential over most southern regions in spring, retreating to the higher latitudes (that is, north of 50° N) and the Rocky Mountains in the summer. In contrast, a dramatic decrease in hail frequency and damage potential is predicted over eastern and southeastern regions in spring and summer due to a significant increase in melting that mitigates gains in hail size from increased buoyancy.”",,Good ,Unknown,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3321,0.44x0.1° (~50x50 km),,"Currently there is no publicly available dataset on hail projections.

Heavy snowfall occurs when moist air is lifted and cooled, causing water vapor to condense and freeze into snowflakes that accumulate rapidly under the right conditions.

Additionally, in regions like the Great Lakes, lake-effect snow can also lead to intense snowfall. These mechanisms make heavy snow events a frequent and impactful hazard across Canada.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
As global temperatures rise, warmer winter air can hold more moisture, potentially increasing the intensity of snowstorms in areas where temperatures remain below freezing.

Teah,Phase 1.1,Snow and Ice,Heavy snowfall,"Mechanisms & Drivers
For snow to fall, moisture must be present in the atmosphere. Snow forms when the atmospheric temperature is at or below freezing (0°C or 32°F). Depending on the ground temperature, the snow will either reach the ground of begin to melt. As a general rule, snow will not form if the ground temperature is at least 5°C (41°F). While it can be too warm to snow, it cannot be too cold to snow. Snow can occur even at incredibly low temperatures, as long as there is some source of moisture and some way to lift or cool the air. It is true, however, that most heavy snowfalls occur when there is relatively warm air near the ground—typically -9°C (15°F) or warmer—since warmer air can hold more water vapor. Because snow formation requires moisture, very cold but very dry areas may rarely receive snow. Heavy snowfall occurs when 10-20 cm or more of snow falls within 12-24 hours or less, with specific values depending on the region in Canada. 

The role of climate change
Snow forecasts and projections are better than they used to be, and they continue to improve, but heavy snow still remains a difficult challenge for meteorologists and climatologists. One reason is that during intense snows, the heaviest snowfall can occur in surprisingly narrow bands, and on a smaller scale than climate models can resolve. Also, the extremely small temperature differences that define the boundary line between rain and snow make large differences. Because conditions in the atmosphere and on the ground can vary, each storm might produce a different type of snowfall. In addition, snow does not fall evenly everywhere. Even during the same storm, one neighborhood may receive deep snow, while an adjacent neighborhood may only receive a light dusting. Climate change will impact when and where heavy snowfall happens.

Carly/Pouriya,Phase 1.1,Wind,Hurricanes and Tropical Cyclones,"Mechanisms and drivers 
Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, are complex storm systems with low-pressure centers and organized convection. They require several key conditions to form: warm ocean waters (at least 26.5°C), a warm and moist atmosphere, a pre-existing atmospheric disturbance, sufficient Coriolis force to provide rotational spin (generally 4-5 degrees from the equator), and minimal vertical wind shear. These conditions enable continuous evaporation and condensation of water, releasing latent heat that powers the storm. 
In Canada, hurricanes rarely form directly due to cooler ocean temperatures. However, hurricanes from warmer southern waters can travel north and impact Canada. As they move into cooler regions, these storms undergo extratropical transition, drawing energy from temperature differences between air masses rather than warm ocean waters. This process can alter their structure and expand their impact, even though they lose some tropical characteristics. 

The role of climate change
Climate change could intensify these storms. Warmer oceans and increased moisture lead to stronger, wetter hurricanes, while rising sea levels amplify storm surge impacts. Shifts in atmospheric pressure patterns over the North Atlantic, as seen with Hurricane Sandy, may steer storms northward more often, potentially increasing their effects on regions like Atlantic Canada.",General,CCCR2025,tropical cyclone,N/A,Air Temperature ,Tier 1: High - Strong agreement in direction of change and amount of change,Mean temperature (seasonal),Mean temperature describes the average temperature for the 24-hour day.,"Air temperature can have a direct impact on the intensity and severity of a hurricane event. The mean temperatures influence the overall heat content of the ocean and atmosphere. Warmer air temperatures can hold more water vapor and provide more energy for storms to become intense. There is high confidence in the direction of change in mean seasonal temperatures with global warming driving higher temperatures. This warming trend contributes to an increased likelihood of more frequent and intense hurricanes, although the precise magnitude of this increase is subject to ongoing research.

Carly/Pouriya,Phase 1,Wind,Hurricanes and Tropical Cyclones,"Mechanisms and drivers 
Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, are complex storm systems with low-pressure centers and organized convection. They require several key conditions to form: warm ocean waters (at least 26.5°C), a warm and moist atmosphere, a pre-existing atmospheric disturbance, sufficient Coriolis force to provide rotational spin (generally 4-5 degrees from the equator), and minimal vertical wind shear. These conditions enable continuous evaporation and condensation of water, releasing latent heat that powers the storm. 
In Canada, hurricanes rarely form directly due to cooler ocean temperatures. However, hurricanes from warmer southern waters can travel north and impact Canada. As they move into cooler regions, these storms undergo extratropical transition, drawing energy from temperature differences between air masses rather than warm ocean waters. This process can alter their structure and expand their impact, even though they lose some tropical characteristics. 

The role of climate change
Climate change could intensify these storms. Warmer oceans and increased moisture lead to stronger, wetter hurricanes, while rising sea levels amplify storm surge impacts. Shifts in atmospheric pressure patterns over the North Atlantic, as seen with Hurricane Sandy, may steer storms northward more often, potentially increasing their effects on regions like Atlantic Canada.",General,CCCR2025,tropical cyclone,N/A,Sea Surface Temperature,Tier 1: High - Strong agreement in direction of change and amount of change,Sea Surface Temperature,"Sea surface temperature (SST) is defined as the temperature of the top few millimeters of the ocean. This temperature directly or indirectly  impacts the rate of all physical, chemical, and most biological processes occurring in the ocean","Sea surface temperature is an important part of the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones. Warmer sea surface temperatures provide the necessary heat energy to fuel these storms and support their development.
There is high confidence in the rising trend of sea surface temperatures. Higher sea surface temperatures are likely to increase both the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, as they enable more robust storm systems to form and persist. In addition, extended periods of warmer ocean temperatures can prolong the hurricane seasons, allowing storms to form earlier in the springs and later into the fall. This could potentially increase the window of time during which tropical cyclones can develop and intensify. Furthermore, as ocean waters warm, these storms could shift northward, increasing the intensity and frequency of hurricanes in the higher latitudes.

Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, are large storm systems that develop over warm ocean waters. They require specific conditions: warm sea surface temperatures, warm and moist atmosphere, an existing atmospheric disturbance, Coriolis force for rotation, and vertical wind shear. In Canada, tropical cyclones rarely form but can impact the country when they travel northward, sometimes transforming into extratropical cyclones, which draw energy from temperature differences instead of warm ocean waters.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change can intensify tropical cyclones by warming ocean temperatures and increasing atmospheric moisture, which enhances storm strength and precipitation.

Teah,Phase 1.1,Snow and Ice,Icebergs,"Mechanisms and drivers
Icebergs are large pieces of glacial ice that break off the end of a glacier/ice sheet that terminates in the ocean. This process is referred to as calving. Calving can occur for several reasons, including the development of deep fractures/crevasses in the glacier surface that fill with water, increasing stress until the ice fractures. Another mechanism that can drive calving is the development of unstable ice cliffs; when retreat occurs, it can create unstable ice cliffs hundreds of metres tall at the end of the glacier, which can be unstable and collapse. Icebergs can be a major threat to ships, and may become a bigger hazard in the future as more shipping takes place in the north.

The role of climate change
Widespread glacier retreat is occurring as temperatures rise, increasing the risk of developing unstable ice cliffs that increase calving. Additionally, higher temperatures can affect glacier flow. Increased flow rates, or sudden changes due to an influx of rain/meltwater, can increase fractures in the ice surface and increase calving.",General,,"Snow, glacier and ice sheet",N/A,Air Temperature,"Tier 4: Not Applicable - Early stages of modelling and analysis, next steps and/or experiments proposed to advance scientific understanding","N/A, Narrative",N/A,,N/A,Poor,,low,,,,,Research Grade,,,"Canada’s Changing Climate Report (2019)

In most cases, water is a trigger and plays a role in two ways:
- Intense precipitation increases pressure in the soil and reduces its resistance. This is particularly the case when the soil is already saturated with water, such as after snowmelt or after heavy rains lasting several days. 
- Wave action, which favours fluvial and coastal erosion when water levels are high, can destabilize and weaken embankments. 
- Other meteorological and climatic factors can also trigger landslides, such as rapid snowmelt, thawing permafrost in northern environments, and freeze-thaw cycles in coastal environments. 
The expected increase in extreme precipitation and storms in summer and autumn is likely to increase soil instability in landslide-prone areas in many parts of Canada.",,,Landslide,N/A,Precipitation,,,,,,Poor,,,CanDCS-U5/U6,6x10 km,,ClimateData.ca,Currently Available,,,"Health in a Changing Climate (2022)

The diurnal and seasonal heating of the continental landmasses results in large fluctuations in temperature, influencing atmospheric stability, and the development of thunderstorms.

Lightning itself is also linked to variations in upper tropospheric water vapour, and tropospheric ozone, both of which are strong greenhouse gases. ",,,N/A,,N/A,,Precipitation * convective available potential energy,,"For USA: Lightning occurs more frequently when it is hotter than when it is colder. Romps et al. constructed a proxy based on the energy available to make air rise in the atmosphere and on precipitation rates to model the frequency of lightning strikes across the continental United States. They predict that the number of lightning strikes will increase by about 12% for every degree of rise in global average air temperature.

** Given the success of CAPE × P in replicating the time series of observed lightning flashes, it is a natural candidate for assessing future changes in flash rates due to global warming.

//
In a future warmer climate we may have less thunderstorms overall, but more intense thunderstorms, which may increase the amount of lightning by 10% for every one degree global warming. 

It needs to be emphasized that lightning-climate relationship based on data for short periods, and different regions, in the present climate cannot always be used as a proxy for future global warming. Different locations may be influenced by factors such as topography, vegetation, atmospheric circulation patterns, ocean currents, etc., that may complicate their use as proxies for surface warming.

Long-term changes in mean temperature refer to trends in temperature patterns over extended periods, typically spanning decades to centuries. Long-term changes in temperature can have significant implications for ecosystems, human comfort and resource availability. They can influence agricultural productivity, building cooling demand, outdoor infrastructure and alter habitats for plant and animal species.

Earth’s long-term climate and average temperature are regulated by a balance between energy arriving from the sun (in the form of shortwave radiation) and energy leaving the Earth (in the form of longwave radiation). When this balance is disrupted in a persistent way, global temperature rises or falls. When less energy is leaving than is entering the system, it leads to a warmer climate. Some gasses in the atmosphere absorb longwave radiation, effectively preventing it from leaving, leading to a “positive” change in this balance and a warmer average climate.

Long term changes in mean precipitation may not typically be considered a climate hazard, as there can be a lot of focus on climate extremes. However, long-term changes in climate variables such as precipitation and temperature can cause negative impacts and should be considered in assessments of hazards. 

""Precipitation, as the ultimate source of water for our lands, lakes, and rivers, plays an important role in human society and in shaping and sustaining ecosystems. Human society and natural systems have evolved and adapted to variable precipitation in the past. However, shifts in precipitation beyond its historical range of variability could have profound impacts"" (CCCR, 2019). Mean precipitation trends impact hydrology and ecosystems over long periods of time, and can contribute to extreme hazards such as flooding, drought, and wildfire. Precipitation is an important factor for ecosystems, so long term changes can shift locations of ecosystems over time. Precipitation is an important part of the movement and distribution of water on the Earth's surface, and water plays an important role in many aspects of society. Long term changes in precipitation may contribute to changes in water quantity, which may contribute to longer term impacts such as water availability for drinking water purposes and uses in agriculture and other sectors. Impacts may also include changes to stream flows which can impact hydroelectricity production and impacts to the growing season for agriculture. Impacts include longer term impacts (e.g., ecosystem shift and regional hydrology) and impacts that may be shorter in duration such as flooding.

The role of climate change
""Precipitation change is affected by a number of complex processes including increases in the water holding capacity of a warming atmosphere, changes in global atmospheric circulation, interactions with topography, changes in evaporation, etc."" (CRBCPI, 2020). Increased temperatures resulting from climate change increase evaporation which increases atmospheric moisture, thus generally increasing precipitation. 

Trends in precipitation over the 21st century in Canada vary based on the region, season, and emissions scenario (i.e., some areas see increases and others see decreases in total precipitation depending on the emissions scenario and time period and interval considered). Generally, annual total precipitation is projected to increase everywhere in Canada over the 21st century (CCCR, 2019). Additionally, with rising temperatures there is a projected shift from snow to rain in the spring and fall seasons (CCCR, 2019) in some regions in Canada. Some regions are projected to see more snowfall and other regions are projected to see less snowfall over the 21st century. 

Precipitation changes vary more temporally and regionally than changes in temperature, so precipitation projections have less confidence than temperature projections (CCCR, 2019). Generally, there is uncertainty around precipitation projections due to the effect of climate change on precipitation being weaker relative to its natural internal variability (in comparison to temperature), the regional changes in precipitation such as orography, proximity to water bodies, atmospheric circulation patterns, etc, and stronger model uncertainties in precipitation projections (in comparison to temperature) (CRBCPI, 2020). The spread of the models in projections (which can be used to visualize projection uncertainties) can be viewed using a scatterplot tool available on the Climate Atlas: https://climateatlas.ca/data/grid/451/plus30_2030_85/scatter. The scatterplot provides a way to explore the amount of agreement within the ensemble of models for a selected location (for temperature and precipitation variables). These uncertainties impact the confidence in the direction and magnitude of changes in long term precipitation.

These uncertainties are part of the risk of changes in long term changes in precipitation, and emphasize the importance of looking at projections of precipitation on a regional and temporal basis. While there is higher confidence that annual precipitation will increase in Canada, there is lower confidence in detailed regional projections (CRBCPI, 2020). Also, the confidence in the projected changes of seasonal mean precipitation is lower than that of annual mean precipitation (CCCR, 2019).

Precipitation significantly impacts water availability, agricultural practices, electricity generation and wildfire suppression. Long term changes in precipitation can contribute to longer term impacts such as shifting ecosystems and regional hydrology, as well as extreme hazards such as flooding.

The scatterplot provides a way to explore the amount of agreement within the ensemble of models for a selected location (for temperature and precipitation variables). These uncertainties impact the confidence in the direction and magnitude of changes in long term precipitation.

These uncertainties are part of the risk of changes in long term changes in precipitation, and emphasize the importance of looking at projections of precipitation on a regional and temporal basis. While there is higher confidence that annual precipitation will increase in Canada, there is lower confidence in detailed regional projections (CRBCPI, 2020). Also, the confidence in the projected changes of seasonal mean precipitation is lower than that of annual mean precipitation (CCCR, 2019). 
",General,,Mean precipitation,N/A,Compound Event (Precipitation and Temperature),"Tier 2: Medium - Agreement about direction of change, uncertainty about amount of change",Total Snowfall,The amount of snow that falls in snow water equivalent. ,"Total snowfall includes the total amount of snow that fall in snow water equivalent over the selected time period. This index was calculated based on precipitation and maximum temperature variables using the Auer method. This is a relevant proxy because it can be used with the Total Precipitation variable to understand the changing forms of precipitation, and is reflective of the changing intensity, duration, and frequency of total snowfall. Note that the Total Snowfall index is different from snow cover and snow depth indices. 

Changing forms of precipitation from rain to snow may cause long term impacts to water management and hydrology. Changing forms of precipitation can also contribute to extreme hazards, such as spring freshet flooding. 

Precipitation changes vary more temporally and regionally than changes in temperature, so precipitation projections have less confidence than temperature projections (CCCR, 2019). Generally, there is uncertainty around precipitation projections due to the effect of climate change on precipitation being weaker relative to its natural internal variability (in comparison to temperature), the regional changes in precipitation such as orography, proximity to water bodies, atmospheric circulation patterns, etc, and stronger model uncertainties in precipitation projections (in comparison to temperature) (CRBCPI, 2020).

Callie,Phase 1,Wet and Dry,Long term changes in Total Precipitation,"Mechanisms and drivers
Long term changes in mean precipitation may not typically be considered a climate hazard, as there can be a lot of focus on climate extremes. However, long-term changes in climate variables such as precipitation and temperature can cause negative impacts and should be considered in assessments of hazards. 

""Precipitation, as the ultimate source of water for our lands, lakes, and rivers, plays an important role in human society and in shaping and sustaining ecosystems. Human society and natural systems have evolved and adapted to variable precipitation in the past. However, shifts in precipitation beyond its historical range of variability could have profound impacts"" (CCCR, 2019). Mean precipitation trends impact hydrology and ecosystems over long periods of time, and can contribute to extreme hazards such as flooding, drought, and wildfire. Precipitation is an important factor for ecosystems, so long term changes can shift locations of ecosystems over time. Precipitation is an important part of the movement and distribution of water on the Earth's surface, and water plays an important role in many aspects of society. Long term changes in precipitation may contribute to changes in water quantity, which may contribute to longer term impacts such as water availability for drinking water purposes and uses in agriculture and other sectors. Impacts may also include changes to stream flows which can impact hydroelectricity production and impacts to the growing season for agriculture. Impacts include longer term impacts (e.g., ecosystem shift and regional hydrology) and impacts that may be shorter in duration such as flooding.

The role of climate change
""Precipitation change is affected by a number of complex processes including increases in the water holding capacity of a warming atmosphere, changes in global atmospheric circulation, interactions with topography, changes in evaporation, etc."" (CRBCPI, 2020). Increased temperatures resulting from climate change increase evaporation which increases atmospheric moisture, thus generally increasing precipitation. 

Trends in precipitation over the 21st century in Canada vary based on the region, season, and emissions scenario (i.e., some areas see increases and others see decreases in total precipitation depending on the emissions scenario and time period and interval considered). Generally, annual total precipitation is projected to increase everywhere in Canada over the 21st century (CCCR, 2019). Additionally, with rising temperatures there is a projected shift from snow to rain in the spring and fall seasons (CCCR, 2019) in some regions in Canada. Some regions are projected to see more snowfall and other regions are projected to see less snowfall over the 21st century. 

Precipitation changes vary more temporally and regionally than changes in temperature, so precipitation projections have less confidence than temperature projections (CCCR, 2019).

Increases in rain will be relative larger than increasees in precipitation, as there will be a shift in the phase of precipitation from snow to rain as temperatures increase (CRBCPI, 2020).

Ocean alkalinity changes primarily due to the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water molecules and consumes CO3 leading to a decrease in alkalinity and an increase in acidity. This process is known as ocean acidification. Many marine organisms, such as corals, mollusks, and some plankton species, rely on calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to build their shells and skeletons. Reduced alkalinity means reduced CO3 and this reduction in carbonate ions can hinder the ability of marine organisms to maintain their shells and skeletons, affecting their growth and survival.

The role of climate change
The primary driver is atmospheric CO2. As atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, more CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreased alkalinity.
Warmer water temperatures can affect the solubility of CO2 in seawater, potentially increasing the rate of CO2 absorption and alkalinity reductions.
Changes in circulation can change the distribution of CO2 and other chemical substances in the ocean leading to localized variations in alkalinity levels.

Ocean density stratification refers to the vertical difference in water density. Light, relatively warm and fresh near-surface water generally overlies cold, denser, subsurface water. In the upper ocean, this stratification is seasonal. It develops in spring and summer as a result of the warming of near-surface water by sunlight and atmospheric heating and the freshening of near-surface water due to continental runoff, sea ice melting, or precipitation. It then disappears with fall cooling and wind-driven mixing. Weaker stratification persists year-round below the winter mixed layer. Stratification limits vertical mixing in the ocean, particularly in the upper ocean in spring and summer. The variability of this stratification from region to region and over time has significant implications for mixing heat and carbon dioxide down into the ocean and for mixing nutrients (needed for plankton growth) up into the surface layers.

Carly,Phase 1.1,Coastal,Ocean - Marine heatwave,"Mechanisms and drivers
Marine heatwaves are events where temperatures are unusually high for an extended period (an event where temperatures exceed the 90th percentile of 30-year historic values for five or more days in a row). MHWs can be induced by anomalous ocean heating at the ocean surface (caused by changes in air temperature, winds or cloud cover, for example), or as a result of horizontal or vertical currents and mixing in the surrounding ocean.

The role of climate change
A correlation also exists between natural climate variability and the occurrence and intensity of marine heatwaves. For example, the “El Niño” phenomenon appears to enhance the emergence of marine heatwaves in the central and eastern regions of the Pacific Ocean. 
The information we are able to present as a proxy for marine heatwaves on ClimateData.ca is only able to reflect the impacts of marine heatwaves caused by sea surface temperature changes and does not reflect the processes that may lead to deeper marine heatwaves. 
Future projections of marine heatwaves must also take into account the shifting baseline of ocean temperatures, which will become increasingly warmer into the future and may cause a misrepresentation of marine heatwaves in the future.

Teah,Phase 1.1,Coastal,Ocean - Marine/Coastal fog/Ice Fog,"Mechanisms and drivers
Marine and coastal fog is a dense mass of water droplets or ice crystals (a cloud) suspended in the air near the Earth's surface that forms when moist air cools to the point of condensation. Marine and coastal fog primarily develop when warm, humid air is cooled and moved horizontally (advected) over a colder sea surface such as a cold ocean current or cold landmass. As the warm air cools upon contact with the cooler surface, the moisture in the air condenses to form fog, this is known as advection fog. 

A second type of fog, sea smoke, or evaporation fog, forms when cold air moves over warmer seawater. In this case moisture evaporates from the sea surface and saturates the air. As the air is cold, excess moisture condenses to form fog. During the summer, fog often will develop over an ice pack or ice-covered waters. It is believed that this type of fog forms when melt-water on the ice surface warms, saturates the air, and condenses to produce fog.

Fog's visibility can vary from a slight haze to dense conditions where visibility is significantly reduced. The specific conditions required for fog formation depend on factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of condensation nuclei (particles in the air around which water vapor can condense). How fog is created is not deeply understood, which is one reason fog can only be predicted only a few hours in advance, if at all.

Off the Atlantic coast, warm air masses moving north with the Gulf Stream are cooled when they encounter the cold Labrador Current, producing dense fogs along the Grand Banks off Newfoundland and south of Nova Scotia. As the air mass is cooled from below, a strong inversion is created (colder air is trapped below the warmer air) causing the fog to persist.The Atlantic fog season reaches its maximum in July. Over the Pacific Ocean, this kind of fog is less common because the temperature difference between air mass and ocean temperature is not as great. Fog typically blows over adjacent land at night, burning off during the day.",General,,,Coastal Fog,"Compound: Sea surface temperature, Air temperature, Relative Humidty, Wind Speed","Tier 4: Not Applicable - Early stages of modelling and analysis, next steps and/or experiments proposed to advance scientific understanding","Sea surface temperature, Air temperature, Relative Humidty, Wind Speed",The temperature of the sea at the surface (tos). In K,"NARRATIVE to be cleaned up:   Sea-surface temperature (SST) plays a crucial role in air–sea interaction processes. Due to its great spatial and temporal variability, resulting from complex physical processes on multiple scales, fog is particularly difficult to predict. 

Changes in marine fog can be well explained by large-scale circulation changes. A small increase in surface air temperature and an increase in RH contribute to the early advection fog onset, and vice versa. (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11707-022-1002-5)

If the mixing of the warmer air with the colder air produces a relative humidity of 100% then fog can form. Considering air that is saturated, as the temperature increases the amount of moisture in the air increases at an increasing rate. Warm air that is near saturation will saturate quickly when it is mixed with cold saturated air. This is because the amount of moisture in the air from mixing the air is greater than the amount of moisture needed for saturation at the temperature of the mixed air. The air, instead of supersaturating, will produce condensation in the form of fog.

The ocean is a key component of the Earth’s water cycle and changes in the rates of evaporation and precipitation are reflected in the relative freshness or salinity of the ocean surface water. Salinity can also change in response to freshwater runoff from the continent, melting and freezing of sea ice, and ocean circulation and mixing. Changes near the sea surface affect the ocean interior (intermediate and deep layers) through processes such as vertical mixing and deep convection. Ocean salinity, together with temperature and pressure (depth), determines the density of seawater, which, in turn, affects ocean circulation, vertical density stratification, and vertical mixing.

Ryan,Phase 1,Open Ocean,Ocean - Temperature,"Mechanisms and drivers
The ocean absorbs incoming radiation from the sun and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and stores it as heat in its upper layers, some of which eventually spreads to deeper waters. Water has a much higher heat capacity than air, meaning the ocean can absorb larger amounts of heat energy with smaller increases in temperature. Regionally, SST is also influenced by other dominant modes of natural climate variability, such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These variability modes generally involve large-scale patterns in atmospheric and/or oceanic circulation, which result in changes in surface winds over the ocean and transfers of heat across the air-sea interface.

Similar to global mean combined air and sea surface temperature (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1), SST also shows a multi-decadal variation related to changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and to natural internal climate variability, and shorter-term variations mainly due to volcanic eruptions and El Niño and La Niña events.

Teah,Phase 1,Snow and Ice,Permafrost,"Mechanisms and drivers
Permafrost is defined as subsurface material with temperatures continuously below 0°C for two or more years. It covers roughly half of Canada, with continuous permafrost prevalent north of the boreal tree line and discontinuous permafrost to the south. There are complex relationships between air temperatures, soil properties, ground cover such as vegetation, and snow cover (due to snow’s insulating properties) that influence permafrost characteristics. Permafrost conditions are also linked to hydrological (e.g., drainage) and land surface processes (e.g., erosion and slope movements). There are many different aspects to permafrost such as it's degradation, thawing, heaving, active layer thickening, thermokarsts, thaw slumps, alas and more. 

The role of climate change
Climate change can affect mean air temperature over land underlain with permafrost. The Arctic is warming 4x as fast as the rest of the globe. The warming of the Arctic and other climate change impacts are thawing vast stretches of permafrost, creating a feedback loop that is accelerating global warming. This warmer air temperature is, in turn, heating up the ground and thawing the top layer of permafrost. Climate change is also affecting parts of the Arctic in other ways — like increasing wildfires — that further thaw permafrost. Some permafrost found in parts of northern Canada contains a lot of ice. When it thaws, the land shifts, forming depressions where water pools, creating what scientists call “thermokarst lakes.” This pooling of water accelerates more thawing, with as much as several meters of soil becoming less stable in just a few weeks.","General, Infrastructure",CCCR2025,Permafrost,N/A,Ground Ice,"Tier 3: Low - Low agreement about direction and/or amount of change, high noise to signal ratio  ",Ground Ice,,"Ground ice is a key geomorphic agent in permafrost environments, and its formation is associated with characteristic landforms including ice-wedge polygons (Fraser et al., 2018; Lachenbruch, 1962); peat plateaus, palsas, and lithalsas (Laberge and Payette, 1995; Wolfe et al., 2014; Zoltai, 1972); earth hummocks (Kokelj et al., 2007b); involuted hills (Mackay and Dallimore, 1992); and pingos (Mackay, 1973).

Permafrost is ground – soil, sediment, or rock – with a temperature below 0°C for at least two years, prevalent in Canada’s northern regions. There are complex relationships between air temperatures, soil properties, ground cover such as vegetation, and snow cover (due to snow’s insulating properties) that influence permafrost characteristics. Permafrost conditions are also linked to hydrological (e.g., drainage) and land surface processes (e.g., erosion and slope movements).
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change is warming the Arctic at an accelerated rate, leading to permafrost thaw, which destabilizes landscapes and releases stored carbon.","General, Infrastructure","DST, CCCR2025",Permafrost,N/A,Permafrost Extent,"Tier 3: Low - Low agreement about direction and/or amount of change, high noise to signal ratio  ",Permafrost Extent (Surface Frost Index - SFI),"This proxy represents an indirect measure of permafrost sustainability based on surface climate conditions, particularly temperature and snow depth.

This is the expected permafrost response to the high probability of increased surface temperature across Arctic land areas, with additional factors such as changes to snow cover, surface wetness, vegetation, and disturbance also influencing permafrost conditions. Confidence in projected permafrost changes from climate model simulations is affected by inadequate representation of soil properties (including ice content) and uncertainties in understanding the response of deep permafrost. [CCCR 2019 CH5.7 Summary]

Different approaches can be used to evaluate the potential impact of continued global warming on permafrost. One often used approach relies on projected changes in soil temperatures simulated by fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice GCMs. Another approach is to employ indirect near-surface permafrost indices that are derived from surface climate valuables such as surface temperature and snow depth. The surface frost index (SFI) is an indirect approach that has been successfully used to evaluate the sustainability of near-surface permafrost under scenarios of climate change. Given the level of uncertainty in direct simulation of permafrost extent in climate models, as well as the unavailability of archived soil temperature information from CanRCM4 LE, the simple SFI approach was used to produce CanRCM4 based projections of future permafrost extent. 

Based on the SFI approach, CanRCM4 LE projects substantial decreases in future near-surface permafrost extent over northern North America. There is very high confidence in the future reduction of near-surface permafrost areas in Canada. 

Nevertheless, there is very low confidence in the magnitude of reduction of projected changes from CanRCM4 LE and in where and when transitions between continuous, discontinuous, sporadic and isolated patches permafrost zones will occur. A key reason for this low level of confidence is uncertainty in the simulation of the baseline permafrost distribution over Canada, which is affected by model biases, and limitations of the SFI approach that considers only surface climate information to diagnose near-surface permafrost status.",,Moderate,Good ,low,CRBCPI/DVE data,0.44x0.1° (~50x50 km),,CRBCPI/PCIC's Design Value Explorer,Currently Available,,,"Health in a Changing Climate (2022)

Teah,Future Phase,Wind,Sand and dust storm,"Sand and dust storms (SDS) are atmospheric events created when small particles are blown from land surfaces. SDS occur when strong, turbulent winds flow over dry, unconsolidated, fine-grained surface materials where vegetation cover is sparse and sometimes altogether absent. These conditions are most commonly found in the world’s drylands—deserts and semi-deserts—and hence this is where SDS are most frequent. Sand storms occur within the first few meters above the ground surface, but finer dust particles can be lifted much higher into the troposphere, where strong winds frequently transport them over great distances. In already arid climates, higher temperatures lead to more evaporation, drier soils, and less vegetation.

Wind erosion also continues to be an issue during recurrent drought periods in the Canadian Prairie Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba but there was a detected region-wide threshold change in dustiness after 1990 that has been attributed to changes in farming practices, at least in part a result of numerous initiatives—both government and private non-profit—promoting soil conservation techniques in the 1980s",,,,,SPEI,"Tier 2: Medium - Agreement about direction of change, uncertainty about amount of change",SPEI,,Droughts generally increase the risk of dust storms.

Land-fast ice is sea ice that is attached to the coastline, sea floor along shoals, or to grounded icebergs. 
This form of ice can either grow in place from the freezing of sea water, or by the freezing of pieces of drifting ice to the shore or other anchor sites. Fast ice does not move with currents and/or wind. 
Formation and growth of sea ice depends on the air temperature falling below freezing (0 °C) and subsequent lowering of sea surface temperatures. Sea-ice growth usually starts sometime after freezing air temperatures are achieved because the freezing point for sea water is near -1.8 °C. In addition, warmer water from within the ocean may reduce the effect of freezing air temperatures on the surface water, further delaying ice growth.

Coastal flooding occurs due to extreme high sea levels resulting from the combined effects of storm surge, wind-driven waves, and high tides. Storm surges arise from wind and atmospheric pressure changes that push water toward coastlines, while ocean tides and wave heights vary with local topography and weather.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change affects coastal flooding by raising baseline sea levels, driven by factors such as melting ice sheets, thermal expansion of ocean water, and changes in regional ocean circulation. In some regions, vertical land motion (e.g., land uplift in Canada’s Arctic) can counteract sea level rise.

Jeremy,Phase 1,Coastal,"Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge and Coastal Flooding","Mechanisms and drivers
Coastal flooding occurs due to extreme high sea levels.  These high sea level events occur when storm surge (wind and pressure-driven driven doming of water against coastlines), large wind-driven waves, and high ocean tides combine.

The role of climate change
Coastal flooding can be impacted by climate change as local relative sea level changes the baseline upon which extreme high sea level events are superimposed.  Different factors can operate in different directions of change.  Over timescales relevant to Canadian climate services, local relative average sea level will rise due to local ocean water level changes, which stem from melting ice sheets and glaciers, thermal expansion of ocean waters, and secondarily, regional ocean circulation changes, and changes in the amount of water stored on land (e.g. dams, reservoirs and groundwater).   Local sea level, particularly in Canada's Northeast Arctic, is and will be additionally impacted by the loss of Greenland ice, which reduces local gravitational attraction and thus will cause regional sea level reductions.  Average sea level in the Canadian context is also impacted by ongoing vertical land motions.  This is particularly important in Canada's Arctic, where land is currently rebounding from the loss of ice from the last ice age.  In this region, upwards vertical land motion may be greater than upwards water level trends, causing net sea level drop.

Climate change will also cause changes to marine storms responsible for storm surge and wave impacts, although these changes are uncertain at present.

Teah,Phase 1.1,Wind,Strong Winds / Storm Winds,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Strong winds are fundamentally caused by the same physics that create winds in the first place: gradients of temperature and pressure. The movement of air from high-pressure to low-pressure areas create wind, with its speed and strength influenced by the steepness of pressure gradient. Strong winds in Canada are primarily driven by extratropical cyclones (ETCs) and modulated by topography, land-sea contrasts, and convection. Topographical features such as mountain passes can channel winds, while land-sea differences lead to sea breezes. Convective processes, like thunderstorms or hurricanes, can also bring strong winds to the surface.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change has the potential to intensify strong wind/storm wind hazards by increasing the energy available for hurricanes and convective storms. However, the exact impacts of climate change on extreme winds are uncertain, and current climate models show mixed projections.",General,"DST, CCCR2025",severe wind storm,N/A,Wind Speed,"Tier 3: Low - Low agreement about direction and/or amount of change, high noise to signal ratio  ",50-year Return Period Wind Speed (U50),"This proxy represents the wind speed with a 2% chance of being exceeded in any given year, based on statistical analysis of historical and modeled wind data. This variable is critical for determining design wind pressures used in engineering and construction to ensure buildings and infrastructure can withstand rare and extreme wind events. 
Caution Note: Wind speed data has high uncertainty due to natural climate variability and limitations in model resolution, particularly for localized extreme events. Therefore, this proxy should be used as a general guide rather than precise predictions, supplementing it with local knowledge and other data sources for critical decisions.","Since U50 is calculated using wind speed directly, and climate model wind speeds are not reliable, it’s not recommended to use GCM wind speed output to calculate projections of U50 without downscaling or bias adjustment. Some RCMs may represent extreme near-surface winds with sufficient skill to take their projections at face value, but most RCMs with resolution coarser than 25 km have substantial biases.

The CRBCPI Report (2020) provides a table of projections of design wind pressures (derived from U50) from CanRCM4-LE for 6 regions of Canada, under global warming levels of 1ºC, 2ºC, and 3ºC. 

They state that confidence in these projections is very low. The increases are associated with greater interannual variability of annual maximum wind speed. However, the uncertainty range for each region and warming level includes zero, so the projected increases are not robust or statistically significant. In plain English, the projections suggest that it is plausible there will be no change to design wind pressures.",Intensity,low,low,low,CRBCPI/DVE data,0.44x0.1° (~50x50 km),https://climate-scenarios.canada.ca/?page=buildings-report#,CRBCPI/DVE Design Value Summaries,,,,"Health in a Changing Climate (2022)

Thunderstorms and convective storms develop when specific climate conditions align: moisture, atmospheric instability, a triggering mechanism, and wind shear.

Triggers such as weather fronts, mountain ranges, or converging winds initiate the rapid upward motion required for storm formation, while wind shear can sustain and intensify storms by separating updrafts from downdrafts. 
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change is expected to influence these conditions, increasing atmospheric moisture and CAPE, potentially making conditions more conducive to severe thunderstorms in Canada.

Caution Note: Currently, there is no single, compound proxy that adequately capture the specific conditions needed for thunderstorms and convective storms. The science is not yet able to reliably project precipitation data coupled with thunderstorms due to model limitations and the specific atmospheric and oceanic conditions required for their formation. Given these limitations, the maximum precipitation data should be used with high caution in assessing thunderstorms and convective storms risks.","xtreme precipitation, including Wet Days > 20mm and Max 1 day Precipitation, suggest that for many parts of Canada instances of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase under all emissions scenarios. This suggests that instances of thunderstorms capable of producing heavy rainfalls will similarly increase in frequency

Moisture is closely linked to thunderstorm severity, with increased moisture leading to larger storms capable of delivering substantial volumes of rainfall in brief periods. Additionally, moisture affects thunderstorm frequency, as humid air promotes atmospheric instability, making conditions more conducive for the development of thunderstorms.

Very high 1-day precipitation totals could be the result of intense, but short-lived precipitation events such as thunderstorms, or may be due to precipitation occurring steadily over the course of the day. Short duration, high intensity precipitation events may lead to flash flooding, particularly in urban areas where storm drains may be overwhelmed. Heavy snowfall events can cause damage to buildings and disrupt transportation services.

Climate change is expected to affect convective storms in Canada by altering key atmospheric conditions necessary for their formation, including moisture availability, atmospheric instability, and wind shear.
Climate models project a rise in Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) across many parts of North America, suggesting the potential for more frequent and more severe thunderstorms in the future. Alongside CAPE, climate models indicate that extreme precipitation events are likely to increase in frequency and severity in many areas of Canada. This increase is often attributed to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, the principle that a warmer atmosphere has an elevated capacity to hold moisture.
Wind shear, crucial for the development of severe thunderstorms, including supercells, is more difficult to model and study. The current understanding, based on the theory that Arctic amplification will generally result in decreasing wind shear across the mid-latitudes, suggests the frequency of very severe thunderstorms could decrease over time in some locations, potentially offsetting increases in CAPE values. However, much more research is needed to formulate stronger conclusions.

Caution Note: There is no single compound proxy that fully captures the conditions needed for convective storms like thunderstorms. CAPE projections remain uncertain due to challenges in modeling short-term, localized atmospheric processes and the complex interactions between temperature, humidity, and instability.","Meteorologists describe the tendency for parcels of air to rise in the atmosphere using an index called CAPE, short for Convective Available Potential Energy. Positive CAPE values indicate that air parcels will feel a buoyant force and rise, while negative CAPE (also called convective inhibition, or CIN) denotes the opposite, that air will tend to sink. High values of CAPE indicate a greater potential for severe weather, and therefore CAPE is another measure of a thunderstorm’s potential intensity. Generally, surface-based cape values (SB-CAPE) of 1000 J/kg or greater have ample energy to form thunderstorms, while SB-CAPE values over 2500 J/kg are associated with more severe storms.

Increase in mean temperature as a proxy for tornadoes could result in higher cooling demands in buildings and strain HVAC systems, particularly affecting buildings without adequate air conditioning systems."
Pouriya,Phase 1.1,Wind,Tornadoes,"<b> Mechanisms and Drivers </b>
Tornadoes are narrow vortices of air that extend from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground. They often occur within larger storm systems, particularly severe thunderstorms, known as supercells. Tornadoes require highly specific atmospheric conditions to form. The basic building blocks of tornadoes are atmospheric instability, moisture, and wind shear. In Canada, tornadoes are most common in the prairies, southern Ontario, southern Quebec, where the flat landscapes facilitate the interaction between cold Arctic air and warm, humid air from the south.
<b> Role of Climate Change </b>
Climate change could potentially alter tornado frequency, intensity, and geographical distribution, though the extent and nature of these changes remain highly uncertain. As the climate continues to warm, changes in the key drivers of tornadoes—instability, moisture, and wind shear—are anticipated. Some of these changes could increase the frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of tornado formation and others could decrease the likelihood of tornado formation. ",General,"DST, CCCR2025",severe wind storm,tornadoes,Wind Speed,,Wind Speed,"Wind speed measures the rate at which air moves, generally expressed in meters per second (m/s). It is a key factor creating the wind shear necessary for tornado development, with stronger winds at varying altitudes generating rotational energy in storm systems.
Caution Note: Currently, there is no single, compound proxy that accurately captures all aspects of this hazard. Wind Speed alone is a limited proxy, as it does not account for other atmospheric conditions needed for tornado formation. Additionally, the science is not yet able to reliably project long term wind speed for tornadoes due to model limitations and the specific atmospheric conditions required for tornado formation. Given these limitations, Wind Speed data should be used with high caution in assessing future tornado risks. ","The wind speed proxy is primarily related to the intensity and frequency of tornado hazards. This proxy provides information on the strength and variability of winds in a given area, which are important for the formation and development of tornadoes.
Wind speed plays a significant role in creating the wind shear necessary for tornado formation. Strong winds at different altitudes create wind shear, which is essential for the development of rotating thunderstorms (supercells) that can produce tornadoes. 
There is moderate confidence that wind speed is a reliable proxy for understanding the intensity and frequency of tornado hazards. Monitoring wind speeds helps predict the potential for tornado formation, assess the likely severity of these events, and help the mitigation of risks associated with tornadoes in susceptible regions.

Callie,Phase 1,Heat and Cold,Winter warm spell,"Mechanisms and drivers
Under climate change, mean temperatures are expected to rise, with the greatest warming occurring in winter (CCCR, 2019). Additionally, mean temperatures are rising faster in Canada's North relative to other regions in Canada (CCCR, 2019). Canada's North is warming faster due to a combination of factors, including reduction in albedo from reductions of snow and ice and increased heat transport to northern latitudes from southern latitudes (CCCR, 2019). Changing temperatures also mean historical season lengths and start and end dates may shift, such as the winter season becoming shorter. 

Seasonal mean temperatures (including winter) are also affected by natural modes of climate variability such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Diple, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (CCCR, 2019). 

Winter warm spells are one aspect of warmer winters, and can show the changing intensity, duration, and frequency of warm periods within the winter season. Heat waves and warm spells are defined differently throughout literature but generally are multi-day periods with high temperature extremes. Warm spells occur any time in the year while the term heat wave is typically used during the warmer months (WMO, 2023). The definition of a warm winter temperature is region and sector dependent. Winter warm spell thresholds may be determined based on temperatures observed during the winter season and be reflective of what is considered unseasonably warm winter weather, rather than the absolute high temperatures for the year asociated with heatwaves that occur during the warmer months.

The role of climate change
Warmer and shorter winters may have impacts such as reducing the length and operating feasibility of the winter recreation season (e.g., snowboarding/skiing, skating), reduce energy use for heating during winter months, changes in historically typical ecosystem ranges, impacts on water supplies, and impact snow cover and ice cover on rivers and lakes. ",General,,Temperature,,Air Temperature,Tier 1: High - Strong agreement in direction of change and amount of change,Heat wave (Winter),"This analysis returns the number of days in a heat wave, defined as >= # consecutive days when maximum temperature > # degrees C (seasonal temporal frequency)","Heat waves and warm spells are defined differently throughout literature but generally are multi-day periods with high temperature extremes. Warm spells occur any time in the year while the term heat wave is typically used during the warmer months (WMO, 2023). The definition of a winter warm temperature is region or sector/business dependent. 

This proxy shows the number of days in winter warm spells, and is a relevant proxy because it reflects the changing duration aspect of winter warm spells. This proxy requires the user to provide their region or sector specific intensity threshold (i.e., a maximum daily temperature) and duration threshold (i.e., number of consecutive days to qualify as a warm spell). The ClimateData.ca Analyze page allows users to choose a 'seasonal' temporal frequency. 

The months that fall within each season on ClimateData.ca are: 
•	Spring: March, April, May 
•	Summer: June, July, August 
•	Fall: September, October, November 
•	Winter: December, January, February 

This proxy shows how the number of days in warm spells meeting region or sector specific criteria will change over time. Note this proxy is not showing the frequency of warm spells or the duration of a single warm spell, instead it provides the total number of days over the time period that are in warm spells. 

This proxy is particularly useful because it allows users to input region or sector specific warm spell criteria. Users may consider calculating and using percentiles to define region-specific warm winter temperature thresholds. Winter warm spell thresholds may be determined based on temperatures observed during the winter season and be reflective of what is considered unseasonably warm winter weather, rather than the absolute high temperatures for the year asociated with heatwaves that occur during the warmer months.

Note that this proxy only accounts for maximum temperature in defining the intensity of the warm spell. Users looking to incorporate both maximum daily temperature and minimum daily temperature should use the 'Heat wave total duration' index available on the ClimateData.ca Analyze page.

Changing temperatures also mean historical season lengths and start and end dates may shift, such as the winter season becoming shorter. Users may want to view proxies on a monthly basis to see how shoulder seasons may shift.

Seasonal mean temperatures (including winter) are also affected by natural modes of climate variability such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Diple, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (CCCR, 2019). 

Winter warm spells are one aspect of warmer winters, and can show the changing intensity, duration, and frequency of warm periods within the winter season. Heat waves and warm spells are defined differently throughout literature but generally are multi-day periods with high temperature extremes. Warm spells occur any time in the year while the term heat wave is typically used during the warmer months (WMO, 2023). The definition of a warm winter temperature is region and sector dependent. Winter warm spell thresholds may be determined based on temperatures observed during the winter season and be reflective of what is considered unseasonably warm winter weather, rather than the absolute high temperatures for the year asociated with heatwaves that occur during the warmer months.

The role of climate change
Warmer and shorter winters may have impacts such as reducing the length and operating feasibility of the winter recreation season (e.g., snowboarding/skiing, skating), reduce energy use for heating during winter months, changes in historically typical ecosystem ranges, impacts on water supplies, and impact snow cover and ice cover on rivers and lakes.

Degree Days Below a Threshold: This analysis returns the number of degree days accumulated when daily mean temperature < ##
degrees C (seasonal temporal frequency)","This proxy shows the number of degree days above or below a threshold, and is a relevant proxy because it reflects the changing intensity, duration and frequency of temperatures in winter over time. Degree Days form the basis for a number of climate indices which are used in agriculture, energy, transport and human health. The threshold temperature is core to the degree day index and, as with other climate indices, some specific temperature threshold values are associated with particular degree day indices, e.g., growing degree days, heating degree days, freezing degree days and cooling degree days. The degree day index generally provides information about heat energy that is available (e.g., in agriculture), or is required (e.g., for space heating in buildings), although there are other applications. Degree days can be calculated above, or below, the threshold temperature.

These indices are available with commonly used pre-set thresholds on ClimateData.ca for different applications such as cooling degree days (less relevant to winter warming), heating degree days, growing degree days (less relevant to winter warming), and cumulative degree days above 0 degrees celsius. The ClimateData.ca Analyze page can also be used to input custom thresholds for regions or sectors, and to review these indices at seasonal or monthly thresholds (such as focusing on winter months). The pre-set thresholds used on ClimateData.ca that may be relevant to impacts associated with winter warming include:
1. Heating degree days (HDDs) give an indication of the amount of space heating (e.g., from a gas boiler/furnace, baseboard electric heating or fireplace) that may be required to maintain comfortable conditions inside a building during cooler months. When the daily average temperature is colder than the threshold temperature, HDDs are accumulated. Threshold values may vary, but 17°C or 18°C are commonly used in Canada. Larger HDD values indicate a greater need for space heating.
2. Cumulative degree days above 0°C can be used to determine when climate conditions are warm enough to support the growth of certain plants and pests. When the daily average temperature is warmer than 0°C, degree days are accumulated. This index can be used to determine the range of some insects and other pests. For example, the black-legged tick, which carries Lyme disease, requires the accumulation of at least 2800 degree days above 0°C for its survival. Warmer conditions can speed the development rate of these species and lead to an extension of their geographical range.

The Climate Atlas also has a Freezing Degree Days (FDDs) index that's relevant to winter warm spells. Freezing degree days begin to accumulate when the daily mean temperature drops below freezing (0°C). As stated on the Climate Atlas of Canada webpage: ""High FDD values are associated with relatively cold conditions: places with high FDD values likely get many days with temperatures significantly below freezing. If projections show a decrease in FDDs, then that location is likely to experience shorter or less severe winters. High FDD likely imply greater snow and ice accumulation, which is an important consideration for winter activities such as skiing, the building of winter roads, municipal and rural snow clearance, and many other aspects of winter life. Such places would likely require a relatively large amount of energy for heating."" (Climate Atlas of Canada, 2024)

Degree day variables are calculated for each degree above or below the threshold on a daily basis, and summed over the given time period. For example, for Degree Days Above indices, if you want to calculate the number of degree days above a threshold temperature of, say, 14°C, then for any day when the mean (average) temperature is greater than this value, degree days are calculated. So, if the daily mean temperature on a given day is 24°C, then there are 10 DDs (24-14=10) for this day. If the daily mean temperature on the next day is 18°C, then the number of degree days on that day is 4 DDs (18-14=4). This value is then added to the total from the previous day to give a sum of 14 DDs over these two days. This process is repeated over a specific time period, e.g., the summer or winter season or the whole year. If, on a particular day in this time period, the mean temperature is below the threshold value, then there are zero degree days on this day and no change is made to the accumulated total. The larger the degree day total, the more energy available in the time period considered.

The months that fall within each season on ClimateData.ca are: 
•	Spring: March, April, May 
•	Summer: June, July, August 
•	Fall: September, October, November 
•	Winter: December, January, February 

While missing the 'consecutive days' aspect of winter warm spells, this proxy is useful for understanding the changing intensity, duration and frequency of winter temperatures over time, which is relevant to winter warm spells. Changing temperatures also mean historical season lengths and start and end dates may shift, such as the winter season becoming shorter. Users may want to view proxies on a monthly basis to see how shoulder seasons may shift.

Teah,Out of Scope,N/A,Earthquakes,"Earthquakes result from the gradual deformation of the Earth's outer, brittle tectonic plates caused by convection currents in the underlying rock. This movement, driven by the heating and cooling of the Earth's interior, can lead to stress and deformation. As stress accumulates within or between plates, it may exceed the rocks' strength in brittle zones, resulting in sudden breaks and the release of stored energy in the form of earthquakes. When rocks break and slip along a fault line, energy is released in various forms, including movement along the fault, heat, and seismic waves that cause ground shaking.",,,N/A,Earthquakes,N/A,N/A,"Generally, the climate does not play a large role in earthquake occurence.

Beneath a volcano, liquid magma containing dissolved gases rises through cracks in the Earth’s crust. As the magma rises, pressure decreases, allowing the gases to form bubbles.
